# Tombo Archive

A very small piece of software to collect all HTML and plain text files within a given folder structure and convert them into a static site.

This software is/must be:

* **Portable** (can be moved around servers and still work)
* **Durable** (intended to last for as many years as possible)
* **Very simple** (nothing fancy, no javascript - just get all the files, bang some header on top, and output into a single folder)
